This is a sample document for testing. It contains multiple sentences that will be split into chunks.
The document processor should handle this text properly. Each chunk should be of reasonable size.
This helps in better processing and retrieval of information. The system will use these chunks for embedding generation.
Natural language processing is fascinating. It allows computers to understand human language.
Machine learning models can process text effectively. This enables building intelligent applications.
